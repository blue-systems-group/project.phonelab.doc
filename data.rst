Sample PhoneLab Dataset
-----------------------

We put up a sample dataset that contains one month (March 2015) of data that
were collected from 11 PhoneLab devices. You can download the tarball `here
<https://phone-lab.org/static/experiment/sample_dataset.tgz>`_. The tags in this
sample dataset are listed in the existing tags page.

We hope this sample dataset can give you an idea of what the data looks like and
help you determine whether or not you want to proceed to the IRB process to
request the full dataset. You will also have a chance to start developing your
data analysis scripts immediately in parallel to the IRB process.

Request More
------------

Once you've download and built our PhoneLab Android sources, added your
experimental instrumentation or platform modifications , and your changes have
been deployed, the final step is to request data generated by your experiment.

We will make a web form available to simply this process. However, here are the
things you need to provide in order for us to create an archive for you:

#. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Letter**. You must provide documentation
   that your request for data and plan to process and publish that data have
   been reviewed and approved for human subjects safety by your institutions IRB
   or equivalent body. Your IRB documentation must match the rest of the
   parameters of your request listed below.

#. **Consent procedure**. If your experiment requires affirmative consent from
   participants PhoneLab will assist you in performing that request to our
   participants. No data will be provided from participants that fail to
   complete the required consent process.

#. **Date Range**. Including start day and end day, inclusive. Days are the
   granularity by which we organize our archives so finer divisions (such as
   hours) are not possible.

#. **Tag List**. A list of all tags to return data from.

We are aware that IRB standards and procedures vary considerably between
institutions, and it is possible that getting your experiment approved may take
some time and effort on your part. However, we cannot assist you with this
process nor will any exceptions be made to our IRB approval requirement.

Once you have an archive this documentation will help you understand the archive
structure and file format.
