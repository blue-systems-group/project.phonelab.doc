Experiments
===========

PhoneLab is a public smartphone testbed. We solicit researchers with exciting
new ideas to experiment on PhoneLab that are made possible with PhoneLab's
ability to modifying the AOSP platform. Over the years, PhoneLab has facilitated
the following smartphone platform experiments.

1. `LTE Handover Analysis <https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/robustnet-handover>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This experiment aims to study the decision policy and performance impact of
handovers including WiFi-Cellular handover, IRAT (Inter radio access technology)
handover, and intra-LTE handover.

2. `Bluetooth Low Energy <https://kabru.eecs.umich.edu/?page_id=971>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We collect information that nearby BLE powered devices publicly broadcast. This
enables us to study the privacy threats they pose. Please make sure you keep the
Bluetooth radio turned on for sometime during the day.

3. `Lock Screen <https://surveys.cs.berkeley.edu/lockscreen/lockscreen.html>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This experiment looks at how users interact with their lock screens. We collect
log information on whether a code-based lock is enabled, how much time is spent
before unlocking the device, how long users take to enter the code and how many
failed attempts occur. This information will help researchers to design lock
screens with better security while maintaining or improving upon existing usage
patterns.

4. `DefDroid <http://defdroid.github.io/>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The goal of DefDroid is to make the mobile OS more defensive to curb the naughty
apps that drain your battery or over-consume your mobile data, storage, etc. We
design DefDroid so that it makes your mobile phone more sustainable
without breaking the main functionalities of the apps.

5. Crowdsourcing Power Outage Measurements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This experiment collect smartphone's charging status data to infer power
outage.

6. `Runtime Permission <https://sites.google.com/site/runtimeperm/>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a study on privacy preferences of mobile users when it comes to
sensitive data requests originating from third party applications.  To that end,
we want to track sensitive data requests and ask users whether they want to
block such requests as it happens. However we hope to prompt the question at
most once per day per user when such a request occurs. We are also hoping to log
surrounding contextual data when such a question is prompted to the user.
