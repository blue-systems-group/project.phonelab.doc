Distributing Surveys
====================

Here are steps to distribute a survey of your experiments to PhoneLab
participants.

#. Compose your questionnaire using a survey provider. Note that **the provider
   need to support embedded user ID in the URL**. `SurveyGizmo
   <https://www.surveygizmo.com/>`_ is know to support this feature.

#. Send us a **survey URL** and a **email template** that we will forward to each
   individual participants.

#. We will substitute the user ID placeholder in the survey URL with the
   device's hashed ID, and send an email to each participant with this URL and
   the email template you send us earlier.

.. note::
  To incentivize participation, we suggest you also provide prizes for the
  survey, such as Amazon Gift card. After the survey, you can draw winners from
  those who completed the survey, and we will send the prize to corresponding
  participant.
