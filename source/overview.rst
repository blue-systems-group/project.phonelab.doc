Overview
========

PhoneLab is a smartphone platform testbed based on Android. As a researcher,
you can add instrumentations to learn how Android works in the wild, or make
experimental changes to test your new ideas. Either way, PhoneLab provides a way
to monitor, study and experiment on Android system at scale, with the power of
full system control.

More details on how to deploy experiments on PhoneLab can be found in rest of
this documentation, but the high level steps are:

 1. `Contact us`_ to state who you are, and what kind of experiments you want to
    do on PhoneLab. We do not have any specific application templates---just use
    common sense.
 
 2. We will determine whether the experiment is suitable one PhoneLab. Typically
    we welcome ideas that requires changes at platform level, which is the
    unique capability of PhoneLab. 

 3. Upon approval, we will create a experiment branch for your on our Gerrit
    server so that you can download PhoneLab AOSP source and make changes.

 4. When your changes are ready, we will merge them into our mainstream release
    branch and push out to participants.

 5. Meanwhile, you will need to apply for **IRB approval** to obtain the experiment
    data generated by your changes.
