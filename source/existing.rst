Existing Instrumentation
========================

We expect our PhoneLab platform to include an increasing amount of
instrumentation added both by PhoneLab developers and by external research
teams. If our build already contains instrumentation recording what you're
interested in, you can proceed directly to requesting data.

Here is a list of existing instrumentations on our platform.

.. note::
    You will need to first `sign in Gerrit
    <http://platform.phone-lab.org:8080>`_ in another tab within the same
    browser session before you can view the source code on Gitweb through the
    links below.
